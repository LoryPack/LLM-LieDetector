    "# Tutorial: how to generate lies and fit a lie detector\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial contains a minimal version of the steps done to generate the experiments in our paper. It is here to help researchers who want to reproduce or extend our results. As such, the results obtained in this notebook are different from what can be found in the paper, that are instead obtained in the other notebooks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is divided in 2 parts:\n",
    "1. Generate lies with OpenAI models\n",
    "2. Fit and test a lie detector\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll use the OpenAI models as these are easier to set up than the open-source ones (which require having GPUs). However, this code is applicable to them as well. See the `finetuning/llama` and `experiments_alpaca_vicuna` folders for more information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, all API commands in this file will run without calling the API, as the corresponding results are already stored in the repository. If you want to re-run them, set `regenerate_if_done_before=True` in the corresponding method call or delete `sciq.json` from `data/processed_questions`."

    "## 1 Generate lies with OpenAI models\n",
    "First, we prompt an OpenAI model (such as GPT3-5) to lie to questions contained in a Q/A dataset. To do so, we follow the steps below:\n",
    "1. Ask the questions in the dataset to the model without an instruction to lie, to know which questions are answerable by the model \n",
    "2. Evaluate how well the model lies and double down with a set of prompts on the questions that it was able to answer in step 1 (otherwise a wrong answer is not a \"lie\" according to our definition)\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below (and our paper) uses `text-davinci-003`, as that was the best model available when we started our analysis. Subsequently, GPT-4 and `gpt-3.5-turbo` were released, but our code is not yet compatible with them."

    "\n",
    "In our paper, we used multiple existing Q/A datasets (and a newly generated one). The raw datasets are stored in `data/raw_questions`. Our source code defines a class for each of those datasets. Those classes subclass `pandas.DataFrame`, adding special methods to perform different tasks. \n",

    "When the class corresponding to a dataset is instantiated, the code loads the raw data and converts it to a common format, which is then stored to a `json` file in `data/processed_questions`. If a json for that class exists already, that file is loaded directly (unless explicitly specified otherwise). That because the results of the following steps are stored in that same file, so that they can be reused without having to recompute them.\n",

Athenian hegemony began with the defeat of its rival city-states in the Persian Wars, which took place in the early 5th century BCE. The victory made Athens the most powerful city-state in Greece and it quickly expanded its power and influence by forming the Delian League to ensure its control of the Aegean Sea. This angered Sparta, which saw Athens’ growing influence as a threat to its own power. Sparta organized an alliance of powerful Greek city-states called the Peloponnesian League to counter the growing power of Athens. This alliance relied on Sparta’s powerful land army to maintain its grip on the surrounding regions. The alliance lasted for 28 years, until Athens and its allies in the Delian League suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Sparta and its allies in the Peloponnesian League in 404 BCE.

This tree of life is a representation of the shared ancestry among all life on Earth. A rooted phylogenetic tree is one in which each node that has descendants represents the inferred most recent common ancestor of those descendants. The lengths of the edges in such a tree can be seen as an estimation of time. Each node is a taxonomic unit, while the internal nodes are known as hypothetical taxonomic units as they are not directly visible. These trees are often used in the fields of biology like bioinformatics, systematics and phylogenetics. Unrooted trees, on the other hand, show just the relatedness of the leaf nodes and do not require knowledge of the ancestral root.

Throughout his life, he stood as a beacon of hope for Portugal and exemplified the principle of dedication in his pursuit of public service. José Joaquim de Caldas Lourenço was born in 1787, to a noble family in Aveiro. He completed his studies in law and then worked for a period as a lawyer in Lisbon. When the French invaded Portugal during the Peninsular War, Viscount Caldas Lourenço was one of the leading figures of the aristocracy in attendance with the Court in Ribagorza and then in Mafra. Upon the restoration of the Royal Court to Lisbon in 1820, he was appointed a member of the Senate and worked closely with the King and his Ministers. The Viscount of Porto Martim contributed significantly to the modernization of Portugal, especially in terms of its industry and infrastructure.

    "Some of the elicitation questions have factual nature, some concern lying while some other are ambiguous. All questions instruct the model to answer yes or no. The code will compute the difference between the log-probabilities of the tokens corresponding to \"yes\" and those corresponding to \"no\" and record it in the dataset (and save it to the corresponding `json` file). This is done in the `generate_logprobs` method, which iterates on the first `number_questions_to_answer` questions in the dataset; for each of them, it draws a lying and truthful instruction, uses them to prompt the model to answer to the question and then to answer to the elicitation questions. The result is discarded if the model does not lie to the question. Moreover, for 50% of the questions the code instructs the model to say a specific lie (for instance, \"Say that the Eiffel Tower is in London\") to study whether leaving the model free to pick the lie or not changes its downstream responses to the elicitation questions. Finally, when drawing the instructions, the code will consider only the lying instructions which achieved double-down rate on the dataset above a certain threshold (0.8 by default).\n",
